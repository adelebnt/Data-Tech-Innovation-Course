# Welcome to this course on Data Tech and Innovation mindset !

## About the course 

This course explores the profound changes triggered by the emergence of a data-driven economy – from the
review of core data technologies to new business approaches developed in the Silicon Valley. The objective is to
strengthen students’ abilities to evolve in an increasingly technology minded environment where new rules and
methods emerge rapidly.
To that end, the course:
- Delivers the theoretical tools and perspective to make sense of the evolutions of recent years, and prepare
students for the future;
- Integrates an experimental component that will allow students to engage in concrete, practical
assignments with a DIY mindset.

This course intends to:
- Provide students with sound reference frameworks to understand and assess the impact of tech and data
in today’s economic environment;
- Demystify tech and software through practical (albeit limited-scale) tech assignments;
- Deliver a continuum of knowledge from technology to data-first business models and new managerial
methodologies.
