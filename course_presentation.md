# General presentation of Tech Data and Innovation mindset

This course explores the profound changes triggered by the emergence of a data-driven economy – from the review of core data technologies to new business approaches developed in the Silicon Valley. The objective is to strengthen students’ abilities to evolve in an increasingly technology minded environment where new rules and methods emerge rapidly.

To that end, the course:
- Delivers the theoretical tools and perspective to make sense of the evolutions of recent years, and prepare students for the future;
- Integrates an experimental component that will allow students to engage in concrete, practical assignments with a DIY mindset.

This course intends to:
- Provide students with sound reference frameworks to understand and assess the impact of tech and data in today’s economic environment;
- Demystify tech and software through practical (albeit limited-scale) tech assignments;
- Deliver a continuum of knowledge from technology to data-first business models and new managerial methodologies.
